# Design Criteria

We want to be able to:

- [ ] edit SVG within any SVG editor
   - gives initial form and coordinates (unconstrained)
- [ ] add constraints to such an SVG
   - using [custom data properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/data-*) (MDN)
   - ..or an external file

- [ ] render this on screen
   - [ ] allow a person to interact with the structure (drag)
   - [ ] ..so that constraints are kept, in real time
